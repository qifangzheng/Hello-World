# Hello-World
This is my first GitHut repository.  I am entering the world of technologies that could impact people's life. "hello world!"
I am an IT professional with ten years experience's of project management.  Before I became a project manager, I had been a Java developer and a tester. Stepping back to the data science world is an exciting decision because I have become increasing curious of data world which holds tremendous information of human society. Those information is hidden treasury until we dig them out. 

Many times, business is struggling of making the best decision. Social scientists are wondering why they do not get the expected experimental results.  I am curious how data science can help.
