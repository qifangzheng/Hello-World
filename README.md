# Hello-World
This is my first GitHut repository.  I am entering the world of technologies that could impact people's life. "hello world!"
I am an IT professional with ten years experience's of project management.  Before I became a project manager, I had been a Java developer and a quality analyst. 

Many times, business is struggling of making the right decision. Social scientists are wondering why they do not get the expected experimental results. Stepping into the data science world is an exciting decision because I have become increasingly curious of data world which holds tremendous information of human society. Those information is hidden treasury until we dig them out and make them more available to the world.
